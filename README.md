In this keyboard, not all three-key combinations work. For example LShift+CapsLk+F1,2,W,S,X,\\ don't produce any code. That is they must share the same wire inside, I think. Aha.. It's keyboard ghosting. So It's good again that I returned RShift (to RWin key).

So, the AltGr and AltGr+Shift layouts will be (RU variant in brackets):
