KB-6016-RUA-mod.jpg ... gembird keyboard after KeyboardRemap.reg  

kb_RU204.klc ................ russian layout, quite normal  
kb_EN214.klc ................ english layout, my own, the most optimal (made with genetic algorithms!)  
kb6016layout.png .......... english layout image  

KeyboardRemap.reg   move useful keys to the lowest row  
Hm-hm, not sure if it's final yet. Maybe it's worth to move BkSpc and Enter to the lowest row (again).  
Now Ctrl and Alt are under the thumbs. I'll try to use it for some time and see...
